abstract = {Long-term phytoplankton dynamics in a floodplain lake, between periods of limnophase and potamophase was studied using the morphology-based functional classification (MBFG). The work was carried out to test the hypothesis that the temporal distribution of MBFGs is influenced by the hydrosedimentological regime of the Parana River, and that these differences can be registered by analyzing the dominant MBFGs in the two periods. Samples were taken in an isolated floodplain lake on the Upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, from 2000 to 2012, and water level, water temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved-oxygen, euphotic zone, maximum depth, and nutrients were used to explain the distribution of MBFGs. 478 taxa were identified and distributed in seven MBFGs (I-VII). MBFG V (flagellates algae) and VI (diatoms) showed 100{\%} frequency of occurrence. MBFG II was associated exclusively with the limnophase; MBFG IV and VII were associated with limnophase periods with higher pH and dissolved-oxygen content; and MBFG I, III, V, and VI were associated with limnophase and potamophase, mainly associated with transparency, nutrients, and conductivity. The MBFG approach represented the trends of each group in terms of its occurrence and biovolume, according to the hydrosedimentological regime, providing broad-scale information on changes in the phytoplankton.},

abstract = {The morpho-functional classifications of phytoplankton have been recently proposed as useful tools in the aquatic biomonitoring. In this study, we compared three different classifications in a range of different environmental conditions, a set of six shallow lakes with different stable states. The studied lakes are located in the Pampa Plain from Argentina, a region highly impacted as a consequence of the human activities. Among the selected lakes, three are in a turbid state, two of which have high phytoplankton abundances (phytoplankton-turbid), and one shows a high concentration of suspended inorganic matter (inorganic-turbid). Two lakes are clear and profusely colonized by submerged plants (clear-vegetated). Only one lake shows a typical alternative steady-state behavior, shifting turbid periods of high phytoplankton biomass with periods of more transparency and development of submerged macrophytes. We compared the three morpho-functional classifications applied by means of multivariate analyses in order to explore how much the variance of the biomass of the phytoplankton functional groups (for each functional classification) was explained by the environmental variables. The analyses performed showed a clear separation of the human-impacted turbid lakes from the clear-vegetated lakes. The advantages and disadvantages of the different morpho-functional classifications are discussed, concluding that the functional approach is adequate to analyze the phytoplankton communities in aquatic systems subjected to anthropogenic influence and for monitoring them. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract This study aims to evaluate the environmental factors determining of the changes in phytoplankton structure in spatial (upper, middle and lower course) and seasonal (dry and rainy period) scales in a eutrophic river (Almada River, northeastern Brazil). In the study period, total accumulated rainfall was below of the historic average, resulting in flow reduction, mainly in rainy period. High orthophosphate concentration was found at the sampling sites. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a increased from upstream to downstream. Geitlerinema splendidum (S1) and Chlamydomonas sp. (X2) were the most abundant species in the upper course and several species of diatoms (D), Euglenophyceae (W1, W2) and Chlorophyceae (X1) in the middle and lower course. The functional groups were found to be characteristic of lotic ecosystem, shallow, with low light availability, rich in organic matter and eutrophic environments. We conclude that phytoplankton community structure was sensitive to change of the river flow and nutrient availability in spatial and seasonal scale in a tropical river.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},
